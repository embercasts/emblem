## Embercast: Emblem.js

[Emblem.js](http://www.emblemjs.com) is an indentation-based 
templating language that compiles to the same format as Handlebars
templates, and is therefore fully compatible with Ember.js. This
Embercast goes over the basics of Emblem syntax and how to start writing
Emblem.js templates for your Ember apps.

## Install

The code for this Embercast is based off of the Ember Starter Kit, so no
installation is necessary other than cloning the repo and opening
index.html from your browser.
